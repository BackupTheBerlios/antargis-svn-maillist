 == Overview
 
 The game is devided into several parts, which have each a specified purpose.
-These parts are:
-* a graphical-user-interface (GUI) library, which is called AntargisGUI
-* a 3d-engine
-* a c++-game-engine
-* the actual game-logic in ruby
+The main difference between parts is the language, in that they're written, C++ or Ruby.
+
+The main language of BoA is Ruby. But because most low-level-libraries cannot directly be used by Ruby and
+for some things Ruby is just too slow, there are some parts of the Engine, that are written in C++.
+
+The game is parted into several layers, that shouldn't be mixed too much. These layers are:
+* external libraries (Ruby,SDL,libstdc++,...)
+* basic-lib, which includes basic functions like filesystem-access, basic geometry-processing, event-handling and so forth
+* math-lib - holding extended math-functions
+* video-lib - providing a (nearly) seamless usage of either OpenGL or plain (2D-) SDL-Mode for video-access
+* sound-lib - providing some simplified access to SDL_Mixer
+* gui-lib - a small gui-lib, that's pretty easy to use and designed for usage in games
+* 3dengine - a pretty small 3d-engine, that can be used for RTS-games (it's not designed to work for FPS or the like)
+* game-lib - basic functionality for RTS games. It includes those functions that are called frequently and thus must be pretty fast.
+
+The layers above are all done in C++. What now follows are the Ruby-parts:
 * much glue-code in ruby for menus, dialogs and the like 
+* game-logic

+== Overview
+AntargisGUI is a C++ GUI-library, that's aimed at usage in either C++ and Ruby.
+It's based upon libSDL and OpenGL and can be run in OpenGL-mode and plain SDL-mode, too.
+However within the Antargis-game only OpenGL-mode is used.
+
+Though being quiet small(TM) AntargisGUI provides a whole bunch of features, like:
+* widgets, windows, buttons, list-boxes, combo-boxes, dialogs, checkboxes, edits (single and multiline), tooltips
+* simple event-handling
+* file-system abstraction
+* UTF-8 and localization support
+* XML-based layouts
+* extendable through either C++ and Ruby
+* basic geometry-classes (2d and 3d)
+* encryption with AES
+* themeable
+
+Because the important parts are written in C++, the main documentation in done with doxygen.
+So for more detailed information and a complete API-documentation go to link:../api/html/index.html 
+
+== Dependencies (deprecated)
+
+This library is aimed at being used by a script language like ruby or python, but it should be still
+usable in plain c++.
+
+needed libraries:
+ruby(-dev)
+swig(-dev)
+libSDL
+libSDL_image
+libSDL_ttf
+libSDL_mixer
+libphysfs
+
+you have 2 possibilities to compile it
+1) use autotools:
+  ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
+2) using extconf.rb /mkmf:
+  cd src &amp;&amp; ruby extconf.rb &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

+== Entities 
+
+=== Introduction
+
+Entities are objects. There are many classes of entities, that have an entirely different behaviour.
+But they have some simple things in common:
+* each entity has an inventory (like in RP-games)
+* each entity has properties like energy or experience - no matter how reasonable this may seem ATM.
+* a low-level-job
+* it can have one (or more) mesh(es)
+* it has many different events, that are called, when certain things happen.
+
+Because events and movements for every entity are computed in each frame of the game (should be at least 25 times a second), that's pretty much to do. Because Ruby isn't that fast, these things are done in C++.
+
+So there is a basic entity-class in C++-code that's called AntEntity
+
+Above this c++-class there is a Ruby-Class named AntRubyEntity, that contains some more basic stuff, that's implemented in Ruby more easily.
+
